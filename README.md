# üßÆ Simple Calculator

Welcome to the **Simple Calculator** application! This intuitive calculator is built using Python's Tkinter library and offers essential arithmetic operations with a user-friendly interface.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Effortlessly perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Functionality**: Quickly reset the display to zero with a single click.
- **Dynamic Display**: Watch the display update in real-time as you input numbers and operations.
- **Error Handling**: Receive clear "Error!" messages for any invalid operations or inputs.

## üìã Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: This library is typically included with Python installations.

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code to your local machine.
2. **Verify Python Installation**: Make sure Python is installed by running `python --version` in your terminal.
3. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

- **Input Numbers**: Click on the number buttons to enter numbers.
- **Perform Operations**: Use the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to execute calculations.
- **Calculate Result**: Press the `=` button to evaluate the expression.
- **Clear Display**: Hit the `C` button to reset the display to zero.

## üß© Code Overview

- **`update_value(value)`**: Updates the display with the selected button's value.
- **`clear_value()`**: Resets the display to "0".
- **`calculate_result()`**: Computes the expression on the display and shows the result. Displays "Error!" if the evaluation fails.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

This application uses Python's `eval()` function to evaluate expressions. While convenient, `eval()` can execute arbitrary code, posing a security risk if the input is not controlled. For production environments, consider using a safer alternative for evaluating mathematical expressions.
